This project is an attempt to animate and plot a 3D donut both on terminal and using a pyplot figure.
The mathematical concepts used in the project are explained in the joint document.

How to use it ?
1 ) You will need Python3 installed on your computer as well as some libraries (matplotlib, numpy,mpl_toolkits..).
2 ) Run the 3D_PyDonut.py file and adjust the size of your terminal till you see the perfect shape of the donut ^^

NotaBene : 
> The animation will be very slow because of the complexity of the program and the 3 animations that are running.
> No code optimization has been applied ! feel free to optimize it ^^.
